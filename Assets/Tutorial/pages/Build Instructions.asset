    the Unity project to your device, the device must first be set to [Developer
    Mode](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/native/android/mobile-device-setup/#enable-developer-mode)
    and optionally set up with [Meta Quest Developer Hub](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/ts-odh/).\n\nTo
    build NorthStar, the project must first be set to the Android platform in (file
    -> build settings)\n\n![](./Images/Build/Fig0.png)\n\nAt this stage, you may
    either plug in the device and build directly to it, or build an APK on your computer,
    which can be installed on the device at a later time. This is done by pressing
    either \u201CBuild and Run\u201D or \u201CBuild\u201D. No other steps in the
    editor should be required for building.\n\n![](./Images/Build/Fig1.png)\n\nInstalling
    the APK from your computer to the device can be done through either ADB or the
    Meta Developer Hub, both of which require developer mode to be enabled.\n"
