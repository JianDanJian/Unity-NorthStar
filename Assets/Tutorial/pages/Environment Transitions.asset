  m_overrideMarkdownText: "# Implementing Environment Transitions \n\n## Overview
    \n\nScenes may require environment transitions to reflect changes in time of
    day, such as from midnight to late morning. Each transition uses a new Environment
    Profile and can be either instantaneous (within 0.01 seconds) or longform (5\u201350
    seconds). \n\nMost transitions occur on teleport warps, limiting the number of
    transitions per scene. We carefully manage transitions to shift from one extreme
    weather and time profile to another smoothly. \n\n## Managing Transitions\n\nSometimes,
    duplicate Environment Profiles are needed with minor variations (e.g., different
    cloud textures or ocean wind speeds) to ensure natural-looking transitions. This
    prevents clouds and oceans from appearing like an unnatural timelapse. \n\n**Example
    Scenes:** \n\n- Beat6 \u2013 Rapid time-of-day shifts within 5 teleport warps.
    \n- Beat3and4 \u2013 Transitioning from clear day to stormy night. \n\n## Environment
    Profile \n\nEnvironment Profiles are data assets which consist of several parameters
    allowing us to create varying environmental, ocean and weather changes throughout
    a scene, see below for a screenshot of the data asset. \n\n![](./Images/EnvImplementation/Fig4.png)\n\n
    ## Beat6 Scene: Example of Environment Profile Transitions \n\nThe Transitions
    in the Beat6 scene were a challenge to implement as the time of day changes rapidly
    which is difficult to convey in less than a few minutes and within 5 teleport
    warps.  The requirements for Beat 6 were to transition from the end of the stormy
    dark weather in Beat 5 into a late morning profile by the end of Beat 6. \n\nThere
    are 6 Environment Profiles for Beat 6 where the starting profile is nearly identical
    to the stormy night environment profile that Beat 5 ends with. A few key changes
    were crucial for setting up seamless transitions from the dark storm profile
    into late morning profiles in Beat 6.  \n\n  - The Skybox \n\n    - In order
    to create seamless transitions, the skybox had to be updated so that the clouds
    had the same values set as the rest of the transitions in the scene. These include;
    \n\n      - Cloud Offset \n\n      - Cloud Scale \n\n      - Cloud Speed \n\n     
    - Cloud Direction \n\n    - If these values vary drastically between profiles
    it can cause unintended results where the clouds look like they are lowering
    in the sky, and/or they move across the sky at an unnatural speed. \n\n     
    - You can get away with different cloud textures however, so long as these values
    are the same, it will reduce any unintended effects, but it is preferable to
    have the same cloud texture as there will be less chance of problems occurring
    during a longer transition. \n\n![](./Images/EnvImplementation/Fig6.gif)\n\n-
    The Ocean\n\n  - The ocean at the end of Beat 5 is quite choppy with a very large
    patch size and high wind speed, but the weather by the end of Beat 6 needs to
    be calmer and sunnier. The following had to be tweaked in order to create seamless
    transitions: \n\n    - Parameters on the Environment Profile: \n\n      - Wind
    Speed \n\n      - Directionality \n\n      - Patch Size \n\n        - Big changes
    in patch size for the ocean were hidden behind instant transitions. \n\n     
    - Ocean Material \n\n        - Ocean Normal Map texture \n\n        - Normals
    parameters \n\n        - Smoothness \n\n        - Displacement noise \n\nBy changing
    the parameters above, more consistency can be achieved between Beat 4 and 5\u2019s
    stormy weather, while also setting it up for the following Beat 6 transitions
    in a way which doesn\u2019t feel jarring to the player as they teleport across
    the boat. \n\nFor the night time and stormy environment profiles, we set the
    Sun Disk Material to be the Moon material so that the light reflections on the
    water are from the moon instead of the sun. \n\n  - This means that when we transition
    into or out of these environment profiles we need to create instant transitions
    where we swap the moon and sun.  \n\n    - If it were a long transition the player
    would see the moon\u2019s position rapidly change like a timelapse.\n\n     -
    We hide this in Beat 6 between the second and third environment transitions,
    and this technique can also be seen in the Beat 3 and 4 scene where we transition
    from a clear day into the stormy night. \n\nTo check how transitions are going
    to flow into one another we can drag different environment profiles onto the
    **\u2018Target Profile\u2019** on the Environment prefab in a scene, in this
    case Beat 6, and adjust the Transition Time so we can get a feel for which transitions
    need to be instant vs longform, and how long those transitions should go for. 
    \n\n![](./Images/EnvImplementation/Fig5.gif)\n\nWe set up the transitions using
    Unity Event Receivers on the Environment Profile prefab and assign them to Event
    Broadcasters on the Teleport Warps in the scene. Once the Receivers are set up,
    we add which Environment Profile the transition will use, how long the transition
    will be, and skybox updaters to make sure the transition is as smooth as possible.
    See below for an example of what the Transitions in Beat6 look like on the Environment
    Prefab. \n\n**Starting Environment Profile in Beat 6:**\n\n![](./Images/EnvImplementation/Fig2.png)\n\n**Final

    Out For \n\n### Sun and Moon positions  \n\n- Higher or lower in the Sky \n\n 
    - Small changes in position can be used in an instant or long transition (5 -
    30 seconds) \n\n  - Large changes in position can be used in an instant or long
    transition (20 - 50 seconds)  \n\n    - NOTE: a large change in position needs
    to occur over a significant amount of time, otherwise the sun/moon will lerp
    quickly between the environment profiles and look unnatural to the player. \n\n-
    Swapping Moon and Sun \n\n    - Must only be done via an instant transition \n\n-
    Try to keep the sun and moon changes on the X axis only, so it\u2019s only going
    up or down and not moving horizontally across the sky (can get away with Y axis
    changes between scenes if you really had to). \n\n### Ocean Patch sizes \n\n-
    Longer transitions require the same patch size because the patch size limits
    the max wave size, if the patch sizes are different it can cause visual inconsistencies
    when the transitions try to convert the ocean\u2019s patch size, i.e. noticeable
    shifting / scrolling as the ocean patch size lerps to the new size. \n\n### Same
    skybox cloud values for longer transitions \n\n- Cloud Offset should be the same
    since this moves the height of the clouds up and down. \n\n- Cloud Speed should
    be the same otherwise there will be noticeable scrolling as the clouds shift
    to their new position \n\n- Cloud Scaling is similar to Cloud Speed, it can cause
    noticeable scrolling if they are different between environment profiles\u2019
    skyboxes. \n\n- NOTE: You don\u2019t always have to set the clouds to the same
    values, this is only necessary when creating transitions which occur over an
    extended period of time. \n\n### Colours \n\n- It can be difficult to work out
    how to manage the colour changes between profiles, especially when the time of
    day is changing rapidly throughout the scene. \n\n- Making smaller changes earlier
    on in either instant or very short transitions (3 - 5 seconds) can help a great
    deal to get closer to some colour values which transition nicely over a longer
    period of time. \n\n- In a Beat 6 environment profile when the moon was in the
    \u2018sun\u2019 position on the environment profile, I had to make it seem like
    the sun was about to crest the ocean. To do that, I edited the Skybox \u2018Cloud
    Back Color\u2019 to look more orange, when typically that\u2019s a darker version
    of the \u2018Cloud Sun Color\u2019.  \n\n    - Considering tricks like this can
    be helpful when trying to create transitions between very different environment
    profile setups. \n\n- Experimenting with Post Processing profiles can also help
    to make the colours transition nicely between environment profiles. \n\n### Relevant
