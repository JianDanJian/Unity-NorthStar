  m_overrideMarkdownText: "# Refraction and Underwater Tint (Not used) \n\nAn additional
    effect to sample the scene color behind the water surface with a fake refraction
    effect was also included, however due to performance costs from copying the scene
    texture, we decided not to use this. The effect is mostly only noticeable in
    shallow waters such as the docks scene, so for this project it was an acceptable
    compromise to maintain performance goals. The effect involves multiplying the
    world space normal XZ components by a small factor, and using that to offset
    a screenspace UV, which is then used to sample the scene color texture. \n\nThe
    depth texture is also sampled at this location, and the scene color is tinted
    based on a simple exponential fog formula: `sceneColor *= exp(-depthDifference
    * extinction))`. Extinction is calculated using the \u201CColor at Distance to
    Extinction\u201D function, which calculates the extinction coefficient required
    to achieve a specific tint color at a specific distance, which can be more intuitive
    than working with an extinction coefficient directly.  \n\nThe water albedo also
    needs to be modified by the inverse of this amount, so that shallow areas of
    water do not contain more scattering/fog than they should, due to their shallow
    depth.  \n\n"
