    \n\nThe subsurface scattering effect adds an extra amount of tinting/highlights
    inside of steep/tall waves. This is implemented by using the length of the horizontal
    displacement from the vertex shader, as tall waves appear where there is notable
    horizontal displacement, and where the subsurface scattering is most noticeable.
    The effect uses a two-lobe phase function, which allows for an configurable amount
    of forward and backward scattering. The result is multiplied by a configurable
    color. While the effect is not physically based, it works reasonably well in
    practice and can add some convincing extra detail to larger waves and help break
    up the uniform look of the ocean. \n\n"
