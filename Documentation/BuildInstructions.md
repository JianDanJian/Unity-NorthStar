# Build instructions

**Prerequisites:**

To build/install the Unity project to your device, the device must first be set to [Developer Mode](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/native/android/mobile-device-setup/#enable-developer-mode) and optionally set up with [Meta Quest Developer Hub](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/ts-odh/).

To build NorthStar, the project must first be set to the Android platform in (file -> build settings)

At this stage, you may either plug in the device and build directly to it, or build an APK on your computer, which can be installed on the device at a later time. This is done by pressing either “Build and Run” or “Build”. No other steps in the editor should be required for building.

Installing the APK from your computer to the device can be done through either ADB or the Meta Developer Hub, both of which require developer mode to be enabled.
